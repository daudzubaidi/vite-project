I got PR release
chore(main): release 1.0.5-alpha1 #143
 Open
github-actions wants to merge 1 commit into main from release-please--branches--main--components--vite-react-swc 

  why If I push dircet to main branch, it create pre-release version. I want to create a release version when I push to main branch.

  or should I do with two jobs, one for main branch and one for beta branch?
  give me solution for this, do describe to long just give me code to fix this issue.
